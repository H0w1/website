Hi! I am Jianhao Xu (徐坚皓),
a Research Associate in the school of Cyber Science and Engineering at Southeast University.
My research lies at the intersection of security, software engineering and compilers. 
I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Nanjing University in 2023, and was fortunately advised by Professor Bing Mao. 
From April 2022 to April 2023, I had the privilege of visiting [HexHive](http://hexhive.epfl.ch/) and being supervised by Professor Mathias Payer.

I'm looking for master students at Southeast University. If you are interested in systems and security, please feel free to contact me!
